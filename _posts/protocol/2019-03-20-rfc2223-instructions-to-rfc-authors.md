[Instructions to RFC Authors -- RFC 2223](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2223) の付録にRFCのnroffマクロについての記述があります。
一般的に、RFCの作成では nroff の ms マクロ（書類用マクロ）を使います。
なのでコマンドは `nroff -ms input-file > output-file` のようになりますが、
nroff では改ページ（form feed）の空行を調整することができないので、
この問題を解決する Perl スクリプトの fix.pl を用意します。
これによってRFCを生成するコマンドは次のようになります。

```bash
nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file
```

Status of this Memo

.in 3
This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Overview and Rational

Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used without significant interference with each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.

.ti 0
Frame Format

The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff. The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier. A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.

Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable form.

Discussion

Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and eradication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-regenerating.  While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be found on logs and cable trays.

Security Considerations

.in 3
Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers are used in a tactical environment.

#### ページの区切りで空白を調整するスクリプト

fix.pl

```perl
#!/usr/local/bin/perl

# fix.pl  17-Nov-93  Craig Milo Rogers at USC/ISI
#
#       The style guide for RFCs calls for pages to be delimited by the
# sequence <last-non-blank-line><formfeed-line><first-non-blank-line>.
# Unfortunately, NROFF is reluctant to produce output that conforms to
# this convention.  This script fixes RFC-style documents by searching
# for the token "FORMFEED[Page", replacing "FORMFEED" with spaces,
# appending a formfeed line, and deleting white space up to the next
# non-white space character.
#
#       There is one difference between this script's output and that of
# the "fix.sh" and "pg" programs it replaces:  this script includes a
# newline after the formfeed after the last page in a file, whereas the
# earlier programs left a bare formfeed as the last character in the
# file.  To obtain bare formfeeds, uncomment the second substitution
# command below.  To strip the final formfeed, uncomment the third
# substitution command below.
#
#       This script is intended to run as a filter, as in:
#
# nroff -ms input-file | fix.pl > output-file
#
#       When porting this script, please observe the following points:
#
# 1)    ISI keeps perl in "/local/bin/perl";  your system may keep it
#       elsewhere.
# 2)    On systems with a CRLF end-of-line convention, the "\n"s below
#       may have to be replaced with "\r\n"s.

#$* = 1;                                 # Enable multiline patterns.
undef $/;                               # Read whole files in a single
                                        # gulp.

while (<>) {                            # Read the entire input file.
    s/FORMFEED(\[Page\s+\d+\])\s+/        \1\n\f\n/mg;
                                        # Rewrite the end-of-pages.
#    s/\f\n$/\f/;                       # Want bare formfeed at end?
#    s/\f\n$//;                         # Want no formfeed at end?
    print;                              # Print the resultant file.

   A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers
